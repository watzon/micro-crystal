# Product Mission (Lite)

µCrystal is a microservice toolkit for Crystal that helps teams build fast, type-safe distributed systems by providing pluggable transports, registries, brokers, and a macro-driven service model.

It serves Crystal backend teams who want cohesive microservice primitives without boilerplate. Unlike web frameworks, µCrystal focuses on RPC, discovery, and messaging with compile-time handler/client generation and transport-agnostic streaming.
