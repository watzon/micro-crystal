## 2025-08-09: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Build µCrystal as a batteries-included microservice toolkit for Crystal with strong compile-time safety, pluggable transports, registries, brokers, and a macro-driven developer experience.

### Context

Crystal lacks a cohesive microservice toolkit comparable to Go-Micro. Teams reimplement transports, discovery, and messaging. µCrystal offers a unified, opinionated approach while preserving flexibility.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Adopt existing web frameworks (Lucky/Athena) and extend**
   - Pros: Mature HTTP routing and ecosystem
   - Cons: Monolith-first design, no discovery/broker abstractions, diverges from microservice goals

2. **Minimal library with only transport/codec**
   - Pros: Smaller scope, easier maintenance
   - Cons: Leaves discovery, messaging, and DX gaps; less compelling

### Rationale

- Compile-time macros reduce boilerplate and runtime errors
- Pluggable architecture enables incremental adoption
- Transport-agnostic streaming future-proofs real-time features

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Faster development with consistent patterns
- Safer runtime via standardized encoding and error mapping
- Clear path to observability and gateway features

**Negative:**
- Larger surface area to test and document
- Macro complexity requires careful maintenance
